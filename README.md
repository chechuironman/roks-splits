There are 4 proposed topologies depending on the deployment requirements, choose the one that adapts better to your needs. All topologies deploy Foundational Services as the Cloud Paks requires them to run, and some OpenShift infrastructure elements are deployed over these nodes.  

ROKS-split-1:
- Foundational Services
- Cloud Paks

ROKS-split-2:
- Foundational Services
- Cloud Paks
- Workers (for non Cloud Paks workloads)

ROKS-split-3:
- Foundational Services
- Cloud Paks
- Storage (Openshift Data Foundation using IBM Cloud CRDs)
