Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (ROKS) is a managed service, which that implies that IBM Cloud manages the masters and are not visible to the users. The target production architecture for a production cluster in a single region is:

The split of components showed above shows the following:

- Infra nodes: they host Image Registry, Ingress controllers (custom and default), default Routers, Red Hat Marketplace. This node type does not consume licenses from the OpenShift entitlement.
- Storage nodes: they host Openshift Container Storage components.
- Cloud Paks nodes: they host the Cloud Paks.
